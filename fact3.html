            Pizza was first invented in Naples, Italy as a fast, affordable, <br>
            tasty meal for working-class Neapolitans on the go. Pizza didn't <br>
            gain mass appeal like it does today until the 1940's when italian<br>
            immigrates brought the classic slices to the United States. It is now <br>
            the single food that most Americans would want to eat for the rest of <br>
            their lives at 21% of survey participants
